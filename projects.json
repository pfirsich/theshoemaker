In July 2021 I couldn't even come up with more features to implement, except TLS, which I decided to tackle in April 2022. After that I thought that not much more was missing to actually host something with it and a couple of hundreds of hours later I am still working on it to make that happen."

Since there seems to be a dire lack of an editor of the TextMate family (to which Sublime Text belongs as well) for the terminal, I decided to try my hand at it. This editor is not intended to be used by anyone else but me, so it can be fully tailored to my needs without compromises. It has multiple buffers, a command palette, C++ highlighting using [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), find and various cursor movements and I already use it for small editing jobs here and there, but some major features are missing to switch to it, which I have not gotten around to yet."

At the time of making this I spent a lot of time thinking about skillful movement in video games (and that I observe it as slowly being less prevalent), so I decided to make a game about maneuvering a single room (theme: “one room”) with non-trivial movement options that can be used creatively. Though almost all of the options included seem to be very similar to some in popular Quake mods like Defrag, I have not played much Quake before making this game (and certainly was not able to pull of anything like this). During testing it was pointed out to me by a friend, that they were very similar which I was not aware of beforehand, so the game is named \"Quark\" (german for “curd”, often used as “junk”) to pay homage. I'm very happy with the result since we discovered how deep the mechanics actually were by constantly finding new tricks and combos and extending the level accordingly. Sadly it is not as accessible as game jam games usually ought to be, since the time needed to properly use these mechanics is more than a few minutes (close to an hour I'd say)."

        "description": "Lost in the Stars is a “mini MMO” with everyone in the game jam venue participating during the presentation. Every player is placed in somewhere in space, being able to move and transmit a signal into a direction. The goal is to find two other players with signals (sounds) different from their own and meet in one spot. The developers have the ability to overview the whole map. They guide the players towards each other by “pinging” them (which shows a special message on the client) and helping them find each other in real life, effectively mirroring what they do in-game. Such a game is obviously very hard to test, since a representative test scenario is difficult to set up. So we decided to make this a one-time event – A game that is only played (and gameplay-tested) once, ever."

The theme was “Waves”, so we made a game in which you play a bat, that is flying around at night and can only perceive it's surroundings using the reflection of sonar waves in the environment. We also put significant attention in to proper support of Google's Daydream VR, thankfully without much technical overhead, thanks to Unity. I didn't really know much about Unity at that point but am now very much convinced of it's power and ease of use. During the Jam I mostly worked on the controls and the sonar shader."

        "description": "Tron Cruise is a 2-player Star Fox/Top Gun inspired TRON-like in which you either have to shoot each other out of the sky or avoid the other player's trails longer than they can avoid yours. The general idea was to make a game with a unconventional control scheme utilizing our laptops' webcams in particular. We used [OpenFace](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/) to do face tracking and use your screen-relative real-world viewing direction to steer the ship. The setup is sadly not very simple, so the online version you can play for yourself only supports keyboard controls (WASD + V or Arrow Keys + L to steer + shoot), but the video linked above can give give some idea of how the face controls looked like. If you try the online version, please consider using Chrome for reasonable performance."

In this game both players play a serial killer that on their killing spree are hindered by their compulsive tendencies to perform certain rituals inbetween killing people. The lists of rituals to complete are randomized each time and both players race for their completion. The theme gave us some trouble, so the game sadly has a relatively generic and blunt setting, but in the end it turned out to be a solid 20 minutes of fun for two bored people sitting at the same computer."
