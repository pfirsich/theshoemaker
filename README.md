This is the repository used for my website. I generated the HTML with [raydor](https://github.com/pfirsich/raydor) and serve it with [htcpp](https://github.com/pfirsich/htcpp).

# To Do
## Tech
* Reprocess Markdown to add `target="_blank"` into links
* Atom Feed

## Content
* CV (public version without sensitive personal info). Add a link to home page.
* Videos
  - exquisite
  - myl
  - muwa

# Notes for Later
* `sort_effort` in projects is roughly the number of 8h work days spent on it
* Sort project links roughly by likelihood of visiting: dedicated page (itch, LD), video, GitHub, other
* I wanted to show the project tags, but it's too much noise and there is not enough space
* Similarly there is not enough space for #commits, LOC or #stars
