  content: Please have a look at the other posts. The last one was 14 hours ago and
    it said that (sadly) the submission time is over. You can upload it anyways, but
    I would probably feel a little bad letting you win. That is something though that
    has to be dealt with when you uploaded it! Hurry up!

title: 'TAG Jam #6 - Welcome Post'
---
Hi everyone!<br />Sorry for the delay, but here's the countdown/welcome-post for #TAGJam6! I won't be using twitter, but for all you interested in doing so, the aforementioned one is the hashtag to use. Ticktakashi pointed out that with this one TAG is celebrating it's half-birthday (which totally is a thing)! Therefore we will have special rules and since I'm not really big on decision making, we will just include a set of two additional rules from which you will have to choose one (or more, which is two and also all of them).

These rules are as follows:<br /><ul><li>Create a multiplayer game (local multiplayer is of course fine too and probably the way to go with such time constraints)</li><li>Create a game without an objective (and (extra sugar) without enemies)! Whether it may be explorative in nature or just some kind of interactive experience or even something else. Make something different!</li></ul>The themes (2 random ones and one of my choice) will be announced on Thursday January 2nd 24:00 GMT/16:00 PST and the game jam will start 24 hours later on Friday 3rd at 24:00 GMT/16:00 PST (e.g. Saturday 00:00 GMT), so you have 24 hours to ponder on the themes.

Feel free to comment this blog entry, so I know who of all you awesome people I can expect to participate!

The full rules are here: <a href="http://www.thearbitrarygamejam.com/">http://www.thearbitrarygamejam.com/</a>

Edit: I did a mistake on the dates. I changed my Windows-calendar to January without changing the year -.-
