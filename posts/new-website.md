title: New Website!
---
I'm using wordpress on a new webspace now. This is the result! Wohoo! Because googling <a title="my name" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Schumacher">my name</a> will never result in anything related to me, I <em>had to</em> choose this domain.

I'll be participating in the global game jam this weekend and will surely inaugurate this website properly shortly after it and when I find time, I will make a short "projects" page with a little overview of the stuff I've done. But what will probably take a while.
