title: 'TAG Jam #6 - Themes'

Okay! The special moment has come; the magic begins. No screwing around - the themes:<br /><ul><li>Outsider - <i>"a person who does not belong to a particular organization or profession" / "a competitor, applicant, etc. thought to have little chance of success"</i></li><li>Drawback - <i>"a feature that renders something less acceptable; a disadvantage or problem" </i></li><li>Affection - <i>"a gentle feeling of fondness or liking"</i></li></ul>(Definitions from oxforddictionaries.com)<br /><br />There they are. All (semi-)randomly (I picked them from a larger pool of words) generated by <a href="http://www.wordgenerator.net/random-word-generator.php">http://www.wordgenerator.net/random-word-generator.php</a><br /><br />Your game has to do with one or more of these themes. The jam time will officially start in 24 hours which is Friday 24:00 GMT/Saturday 00:00 GMT/Friday 16:00 PST/4pm PST (now I hope that everybody knows when it is) and will last for 48 hours.<br /><br />Don't forget the special rules for TAG Jams half-birthday! - <a href="http://theshoemaker.de/2013/12/tag-jam-6-welcome-post/">Look here!</a>
