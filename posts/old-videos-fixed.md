title: Old Videos Fixed
---
Some of you may have noticed, that most of the posts tagged with "from old blog" have broken videos. It turns out that it is not super easy to get a high quality video from unpublished blogspot blog posts (that's what I did with my old blog), but I managed to find most of the old ones.

The following posts now have proper videos and I encourage you to watch them in their full HD glory:

* <a href="http://theshoemaker.de/2013/04/spacewalk-part-1/">Spacewalk</a>
* <a href="http://theshoemaker.de/2013/12/metroidlike-2d-water-bone-animations-catching-up-part-1/">Metroidlike</a>
* <a href="http://theshoemaker.de/2013/01/feedback-effect/">Feedback-Effect</a>

Also I found videos of a few demoscene-related things I started when I was a little younger. I never really participated in the demoscene, but was a long time admirer and of course tried to do similar stuff myself, but the results were rather lame. One of these things is an attempt at a 4KB intro, which you can see here:

In retrospect I think it's quite neat and I probably should have finished it. But I felt a little intimidated and inadequate next to these things:
