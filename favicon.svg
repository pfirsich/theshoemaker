   "Technique?" said the programmer, turning from his terminal,
   "What I follow is Tao â€” beyond all techniques!
   When I first began to program,  I would see before me the whole problem in one mass.
   After three years, I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines.
   But now I see nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void.
   My senses are idle. My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct.
   In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are difficult problems.
   I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently.
   Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke.
   I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being.
   I close my eyes for a moment and then log off."

   Consider this an easter egg. But if you found this on GitHub, it doesn't count!
